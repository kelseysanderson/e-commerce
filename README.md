  ## Description
  An back-end application developed that displays, updates, posts, and deletes data by using an Express.js API and sequelize that interacts with a MySQL database.


  ## Installation
  To install, clone this from my repository by entering git clone https://github.com/kelseysanderson/e-commerct.git in a terminal in a new directory. Then, when successfully cloned, type `npm install` in the terminal within that directory. You will need to then enter your MySQL credentials in the .envEXAMPLE file.

  ## Usage
  Following installation, open the terminal in the new directory and enter `node seeds/index.js` to seed the data. Following that, type `npm run watch` to start the server. Then use insomnia or postman to access the routes. The given route is http://localhost:3001/. 
  The current routes include:
      /api/categories
      /api/products
      /api/tags
